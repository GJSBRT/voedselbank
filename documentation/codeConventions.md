# Code conventions

## Functions
Functions will be written with a starting bracket at the end of a function, like the example below.
```php
public function foo() {
    return $bar;
}
```

## Naming
Naming files will be done as Laravel does. For example model names will have camelCase and migrations will have snake_case.
